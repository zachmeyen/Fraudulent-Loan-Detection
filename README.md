# Fraudulent-Loan-Detection
This code and writup is for a final project for a 4th year level predictive analytics course for University. The goal was to predict the "loss" variable and the "fraudulent" variable. 

The project was scored competitvely and had very little rules or guidleines. My code was the 2nd best in the class.
